## Topic 
The topic we have chosen is the internet on trains, particularly the ICE trains of the "Deutsche Bahn".
On most of these trains free Wi-Fi is available and the "Deutsche Bahn" also promotes with it.  We want to take a look at the Wi-Fi on these trains 
and analyze what factors influence it and how good it really is. 
## Audience
Our audience is people who travel with the ICE and want to use the Wi-Fi. \
It is especially appealing to people who frequently travel with the ICE and need to use the Wi-Fi for work purposes. 

## Questions 
1. Does the amount of users influence the data rate?
2. Does the speed of the train affect the data rate?
3. How good are the data rates on average?
4. Does the location influence the data rates? \
You could also ask what other factors could influence the data rates. 
## Plan 
For Question 1: \
To answer this question we need information about the amount of users on the train and the corresponding data rates. \
Ideally the answer could be shown in a graph with the amount of users on the x-axis and the data rates on the y-axis. \
This what should clearly if with more users the data rate would go up, down or stay the same. \
\
For Question 2:\
To answer this question we would need the speed of the trains at various moments and the data rates. \
We would need data that is comparable, so we need data in which the user amount is the same and the only affecting \
factor is the speed. 
This could also be shown in a graph.\
\
For Question 3: \
To answer this question we would need a lot of data rates for different scenarios. \
The answer for this could be just a number, but a bar graph could also be used to visualize it.

For Question 4:\
For this we would need the GPS coordinates of the trains and the data rates. We could cluster these coordinates \
into regions which have trains at different speeds and with different users. Then we could compare these regions \
with regions that have similar speeds and users to see if the location does make a difference. Or we could just \
look at the GPS coordinates and compare trains with the same speed and user amount but with different GPS coordinates.\
The best way to visualize this would be with a map and coloring regions differently depending on the influence.
